# Common Conventions

lowercase and snake_case, constants in all caps
PI = 3.14

UpperCamelCase for classes
__dont_touch__ variables "not meant to be touched"

Data Types

bool	True or False, less space to store in  memory
int		integers
str		a sequence/array of characters, in "" or ''

Data Structures

list	an ordered sequence of values
dict	a collection of keys with associated values (unordered)
		kinda like a variable with two sections.

Variables can change type as well as value - Dynamically typed language
None is how Python represents nothingness/null/no value. Define variables with no value.
