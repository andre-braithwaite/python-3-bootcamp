An ordered collection of items
Unlike a list, it cannot be changed!
Can't update or delete values

tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
can't do tup1[2] = 7 will error

so why use it instead of a list? Tuples are faster. 
Use if it's not going to change.

months = ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec')

Useful as keys in a dictionary

Methods

index(), count()
(same as list)
