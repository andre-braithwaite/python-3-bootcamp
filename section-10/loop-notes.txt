iterable objects like, lists, strings, ranges

ranges generate sequences of numbers, normally for for loops.
default starts and zero and excludes last number e.g. range(7)
3rd argument is step number

range(1, 10, 2) is the odd numbers from 1 - 10

while loops

while boolean_expression: <- is truthy
	do stuff

For loops tend to be shorter and quicker to write
While better when interating a variable number of times.
