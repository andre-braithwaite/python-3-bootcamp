A bunch of related code we can re-use when invoked or "called"
usually different input for varied output

Compute similar procedures over and over
print() is a built in function

Abstract code into organised building blocks
divide "work" into discrete tasks

Need to explicitly state what is being returned (output from the function)
What am I expecting to "get out" of this function?

def name_of_function(param_a, param_b):
	# block of code
	return


return will exit the function and remove it from the call stack, jumping to after where it was called.

function parameters are only accessible in the scope of the function

Parameters are variables in a method/function definition.
	- Arguments are specific data passed into a parameter when it's called
